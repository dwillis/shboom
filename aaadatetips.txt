
<p align="left">Finding items by dates or parts of dates can be difficult
because dates&nbsp; frequently are stored as dates and times. </p>
<p align="left">For example, [date field] date may be stored as <i>4/22/2003
5:24:38 PM</i>. If you were to search for<i> 4/22/2003</i>, you would not find <i>4/22/2003
5:24:38 PM </i>or any other records that also recorded a time for that date.</p>
<p align="left">To see if dates also contain times, click on the [group by page]
link and, in the pulldown under &quot;Select one or more fields to group
by&quot; select a date field, [date field] for example. If you're dealing with a
large table, you might want to limit the results set. In the area under
&quot;Select records that meet the following conditions,&quot; select [date
field] under &quot;Field;&quot; select &quot;contains&quot; under &quot;Show
Rows Where;&quot; and type 2003 under &quot;Value 1.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">If results show dates and times, you'll have to deal with date
searches accordingly. Generally, you'll use one of two methods: a <b>range</b>
search, which is faster, or a <b>cast </b>search which is easier to set up.</p>
<h3 align="left">Range Searches</h3>
<p align="left">To search for any records containing the date <i>4/22/2003 </i>in
the [date field], first click on the [filter page] link. Under
&quot;Field,&quot; select [Date Field]. Under &quot;Show Rows Where,&quot;
select &quot;is greater than or equal to.&quot; Type in &quot;4/22/2003&quot;
(without the quotes) under &quot;Value 1.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Next, select &quot;And&quot; from the first &quot;And / or&quot;
pulldown. Staying on the same row, select &quot;is less than&quot; from the
&quot;Show Rows Where&quot; pulldown to the right of the &quot;And / or&quot;
pulldown. Then, under &quot;Value 2&quot; type in &quot;4/3/2003&quot; (without
the quotes). Click &quot;Submit&quot; and the program will search for any
records that have <i>4/2/2003 </i>in the [date field].</p>
<h3 align="left">Cast Searches</h3>
<p align="left">When you select a date, say [date field], on the filter page,
and select any of the following functions in the &quot;Show Rows Where&quot;
pulldown:</p>
<p align="center">begins with<br>
does not begin with<br>
ends with<br>
does not end with<br>
contains<br>
does not contain</p>
<p align="left">The program will <i>cast</i> the stored date as a string of
text. When this happens the program converts the date to a format that is not
intuitive. Unless you know the quirks of the conversion process you will have a
difficult time find dates using any of the above mentioned operators.</p>
<p align="left">Our example of <i>4/22/2003 5:24:38 PM </i> would be cast as <i>Apr
22 2003&nbsp; 5:24:38 PM. </i>So, if you wanted to find all records containing
the date 4/22/2003, you would select the &quot;begins with&quot; operator and
enter &quot;Apr 22 2003&quot; (without quotes) under Value 1. (You could also
select the &quot;contains&quot; operator, but &quot;begins with&quot; is <i>always</i>
faster than &quot;contains.&quot;) <b>Note: </b>There is no comma separating the
date and the year.</p>
<p align="left">Things get a little trickier when you're dealing with
single-digit dates, such as April 2. The conversion program inserts a space
before any single-digit date (or single-digit times). So if you were to search
for all dates that happened on April 2, regardless of the year, you would select
the &quot;begins with&quot; operator and enter &quot;Apr&nbsp; 2&quot; (that's <i>a-p-r-space-space-2,
</i>without the quotes) in the Value 1 box. If you enter <i>a-p-r-space-2</i>,
that is Apr 2 with a single space, you would find every date in the twenties
during April, but <i>not</i> April 2nd.</p>
<p align="left">If you're looking for records in a particular year, it
safer&nbsp; to use the &quot;contains&quot; operator, rather than the &quot;ends
with&quot; operator. If the date field also is storing times, the stored date
will not end with the year, but with the time. So, to look for dates in 2003,
use &quot;contains&quot; and enter 2003 in the Value box.</p>



<h3>To compare one field to another on the Filter Page:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>On the Filter Page, select one of the fields from the pull-down menu
      under &quot;Fields&quot;.</li>
    <li>Select the comparison you want to make from the pull-down menu under
      &quot;Show Rows Where.&quot; (Note: only the first six selections (equals,
      does not equal, is greater than or equal to, is greater than, is less
      than, is less than or equal to) will work with field comparisons.</li>
    <li>On this page, highlight&nbsp; the &quot;Field Name&quot; (and <b>not</b>
      the &quot;Field Alias&quot;) you want to compare, copy it (Ctrl-V on the
      keyboard or Edit | Copy from the Internet Explorer menu bar) and paste it
      into the &quot;Value 1&quot; box on the Filter Page. Example: [initw] for
      the &quot;Initial Wilfull&quot; field. Capitalization does not matter; the
      application is not case sensitive.</li>
